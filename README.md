# TREE SAFE TEST PLATFORM
This project aims to stop waisting paper on school tests by proving a virtual platform where students could use their smartphones to take their tests.

This platform is a not a solve-from-home solution, it's just a virtual way to take a test inside the school without printing the tests and hence waisting paper.

This is a work in progress project made by the students at [ITSUR](http://www.itsur.edu.mx).
